        "\n",
        "**atan2(y, x)** is a function that computes the arc tangent of $y/x$ in radians, but unlike **atan(y/x)**, it takes two arguments instead of one. The inputs are the coordinates of a point $(x, y)$ that is not the origin. The result is the angle of the vector from the origin to this point, with respect to the positive X-axis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how it differs from simple atan:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **atan2** gives a result in the range $(-\\pi, \\pi]$. This means it can return a unique angle for every unique point in the plane, except the origin (which doesn't have a well-defined angle).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **atan(y/x)** can only give a result in $(-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$. This is because it doesn't know about the signs of $x$ and $y$ individually, only their ratio.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **atan2** is also defined when x is zero (resulting in $\\pi/2$ or $-\\pi/2$ depending if $y$ is positive or negative), whereas **atan(y/x)** is undefined when $x$ is zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of programming and mathematics, **atan2** is commonly used over **atan** when converting Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ to polar coordinates $(r, theta)$. This is because it can handle cases that **atan** cannot, such as when $x$ is zero."
